# What is this repo?

I learned a lot from the programming assignments in my operating systems class, so I wanted to preserve my work so I can refer to it later.

# Warning!!!!

Do *_NOT_* use the code in this repository to cheat on your homework. I haven't put any class specific information in here so it should hopefully not show up in any Google searches students of this class might do. If you use the code in this repository in your assignments, you do so at your own risk and without my permission.
